# Spacecraft-EPS-Simulator  

It is a multi-threaded program using POSIX pthread API. It simulates some functionality of the power system on a spacecraft. It updates the battery's voltage, current and temperature readings constantly. It also check these values to see that the values are within an expected range, and finally check to see if the power system as a whole is doing okay.  

***GOAL***  

Make use of several multithreading pthread calls. Introduce multitasking, synchronistion, and resource protection and sharing. Some components of an embedded power system might actually be programmed.  

***Language Used***  

C

***Things Learnt***  

Multi threading and Processes 
POSIX pthread  
Microkernal- FreeRTOS  
Synchronization-Mutex  
Electronic Power System Board      



Thanks!
